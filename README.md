# Mana-script
mana-script is a simple programming language built using the LLVM framework. Inspired by the Kaleidoscope tutorial, this project demonstrates the process of building a basic language, from lexical analysis to code generation.

## Chapters Implemented:
Chapter 1: Lexer & Basic Parsing
We implement a simple lexer and parser to process the basic structure of the language.

Chapter 2: Code Generation to LLVM IR
With the lexer and parser in place, we generate LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) code that can be compiled and executed.
